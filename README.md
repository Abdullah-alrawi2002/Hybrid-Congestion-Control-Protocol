# Hybrid-Congestion-Control-Protocol
This project implements an optimized congestion control protocol for UDP communication, designed to maximize throughput while minimizing average packet delay and jitter. By combining the proactive congestion detection of Vegas with the fairness and robustness of CUBIC, the protocol ensures stable performance across varying network conditions.
